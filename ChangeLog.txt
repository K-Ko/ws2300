ws2300-1.9 Tue,  6 May 2014 01:25:38 +1000
  * New:  Use lsb init functions.
  * Bug:  Wind speed is binary, not bcd.  Thanks to Matthew Wall.
  * New:  Move to sourceforge.

ws2300-1.8 Mon Aug 26 21:01:00 EST 2013
  * New:  Added documentation for the HistoryMeasure class.
  * Bug:  Fixed the "Extending ws2300" example.
  * New:  Delay initialising history.

ws2300-1.7 Thu Apr 12 13:25:00 EST 2012
  * New:  Force python warnings on.  Python 2.7 turns them off by default.
  * Bug:  Implement 'status' in ws2300.init, and add LSB description header.
  * Bug:  Remove init.d dependency on etc-setserial.  Doesn't always exist.

ws2300-1.6 Wed Nov 30 08:53:30 EST 2011
  * Bug:  rhhw should be conv_stmp, not conv_rain.

ws2300-1.5 Thu, 14 Apr 2011 15:34:07 +1000
  * Bug:  Pull version number from this file so pbuilder works.

ws2300-1.4 Tue, 28 Dec 2010 09:25:37 +1000
  * Bug:  Implement suggestions from Stefan Bethke so it works on FreeBSD.
  * Bug:  Using subprocess instead of popen2 for python 2.6.
  * Bug:  Fix html formatting errors in ws2300.html.
  * Bug:  Remove rpm packaging is it was broken by the removal of
	  macrofiles in rpm-4.6.
  * New:  Move license from the EPL to the AGPL.

ws2300-1.3 Tue, 29 Jan 2008 16:32:38 +1000
  * New:  When in record/display, ensures the pressures returned by the
	  ws2300 look sane, and retry the reading up to five times if not.
	  The ws2300 seems to occasionally return bad pressures.  It would
	  be nice to do this with other values, but unlike pressures all
	  possible values returned look sane.  If other values are returned
	  we will have to rate of change checking as well.
  * New:  Added rpm package.
  * Bug:  Wasn't advancing the time correctly, causing duplicate records
	  to be written for a save period.

ws2300-1.2 Mon, 21 Jan 2008 19:29:21 +1000
  * New:  Added retrying SQL operations.  If an SQL operation fails for what
	  looks to be a transient reason the connection is re-opened and the
	  operation is tried again.  If the operation doesn't work after
	  retrying for 60 seconds it fails.
  * New:  Added a recovery file.  Samples obtained but not yet saved by a
	  record operation can be written to a recovery file.  The file is
	  read on startup and any unwritten data in it is processed.   This
	  prevents restarts of the daemon from loosing too much information.
	  If the configuration is changed between restarts missing samples
	  are taken from the current weather readings.  Warning: this
	  heuristic yields poor results when the configuration is changed
	  and the daemon is restarted much later.
  * New:  Added serial port sharing.  When the daemon is running it has the
	  serial port locked, preventing another instance of ws2300 from
	  accessing the weather station.  This is a nuisance when doing
	  maintenance like fixing the time.  The daemon can now make the
	  serial port available to other instances of ws2300 via a TCP socket.
	  As communications to the ws2300 is very slow this feature can't be
	  used too heavily.
  * Bug:  The absolute pressure was returning the relative pressure.

ws2300-1.1 Tue, 18 Dec 2007 19:09:08 +1000
  * New:  Changed the way the computer time is read.  It is now available
	  returned in the measurements cd, ct, and cw.  starttime and endtime
	  are now the times the sampling session was supposed to start and
	  end, not the actual times it did start and end.
  * New:  Added resetting the stations date and time.  They are set to the
	  current computer time, ie cd and ct.

ws2300-1.0 Mon,  5 Nov 2007 13:31:33 +1000
  * New:  Changed record so it can support multi data sinks.
  * New:  Changed record so it can put the program in the background.
  * New:  Changed record so it can send email if it fails.
  * New:  Added median values to things that can be displayed or recorded.
  * New:  Added sample ws2300.rc script for /etc/init.d.
  * New:  Added sample ws2300.default file for /etc/default.

ws2300-0.9 Fri, 14 Sep 2007 16:11:35 +1000
  * New:  Initial release.
