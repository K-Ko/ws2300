<h1>Ws2300<br>A driver for the LaCrosse WS-2300</h1>

<p>
  Ws2300 manipulates the LaCrosse WS-2300 weather station via its
  RS232 interface.  It can read and write values, and can
  continuously log data from WS-2300 to a file or SQL database.
</p>

<p>
  I use this program with a WS-2300, and others have reported it working
  on a WS-2357.  It probably works with every LaCrosse WS-23xx weather
  station that connects to a computer using serial or USB.
</p>

<p>
  The primary differences between Ws2300 and LaCrosse's software is:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is open source.</li>
  <li>It runs on Linux.</li>
  <li>It can be easily extended.</li>
  <li>It is a console application.</li>
</ul>
